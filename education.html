    <h1>Education</h1>
      <p>As an educator in higher ed, I tell my students that you will know what your major is when you are excited to read the textbook and happy to go to class. That's how I learned Psychology was for me. I received my Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology at the <a href="https://welcome.miami.edu" target="_blank">University of Miami</a> with 3 minors in French, English, and Family & Human Services. This track naturally led me to develop an interest in counseling. Making individuals more aware of the influence of mental health on our well-being became a priority. I received a Master of Science degree in Counselor Education at <a href="https://www.fiu.edu" target="_blank">Florida International University</a> (FIU).</p>
      <p>Working in a college, it made sense to enroll in a doctoral program in Higher Education at FIU to help fulfill what I felt was missing in my career. Based on my work as an educator, my qualitative study focused on the lived experiences of female academic advisors. Through semi-structured interviews, the women discussed their career aspirations, interpersonal relationships between coworkers, and their day-to-day duties. In part, the research intended to highlight an important group of people who are sometimes overlooked in higher education research: staff members.</p>

    <p>In 2020, I decided to challenge myself so I dove into the world of technology and design. I am currently enrolled in a Master's program through the <a href="http://www.ufl.edu" target="_blank">University of Florida</a> in Mass Communication (with a concentration in Web Design). I plan to finish my degree in the Spring of 2022.</p>
    <p>Although it is a degree in Mass Communication, the program is a wonderful mix of graphic design, HTML/CSS coding and a few other subjects. Some of the courses I have taken so far include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Digital Layout and Design</li>
      <li>Digital Imagery in Web Design</li>
      <li>Corporate and Brand Identity on the Web</li>
      <li>Web Design Principles</li>
      <li>User Experience (UX) Theory and Research</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I am currently taking Mass Communication Theory, which includes innovative assignments written in blog form. You can see some of my posts <a href="https://alexandralejarza.weebly.com/blog" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
