    <h1>Career</h1>
    <h2>Current Roles</h2>
    <h3>Learning Disability Specialist</h3>
    <p>Since 2018, I have been assisting college students with documented disabilities. I review medical records and psychological evaluations and provide recommended accommodations to promote student success. I am often tasked with creating training materials, handouts, and messages that help communicate important information about the department.</p>

    <h3>Adjunct Professor of Psychology and Student Life Skills</h3>
    <p>I teach a variety of Student Life Skills and Psychology classes to undergraduate students (my favorite is Human Growth and Development!). Due to the demands of my full-time work schedule and graduate school, I typically teach on Saturday mornings. However, being in the classroom is one of my favorite things and it never feels like a job. I have adapted my course materials for blended/hybrid and fully-virtual/remote teaching. I currently use the Blackboard LMS at my institution.</p>

    <h3>Psychology Expert Q&A for study.com</h3>
    <p>As a contract employee, I provide thorough and concise explanations for various topics in Psychology for an e-learning company.</p>

    <h2>Previous Roles</h2>
    <h3>Senior Academic Advisor</h3>
    <h3>Career Readiness Advisor</h3>
    <h3>Lab Instructor for Reading & Writing College Prep courses</h3>
    <h3>Notetaker and Tutor</h3>
